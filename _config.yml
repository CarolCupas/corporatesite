  excerpt: I am passionate about technology, photography, graphic design, and nature. During 2020, I reinvented myself to offer consulting in web solutions according to the needs of companies such as the creation of the digital logo, website, social networks, professional email, data analytics, among others. These solutions aim to help companies have a presence in digital media to present their products and/or services online.
