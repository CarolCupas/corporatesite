Â¿Who doesn't like to get one's your own way?

I do not consider myself someone 100% competitive because I want to enjoy what I do rather than winning at all costs. In my childhood, the board games were all the rage and there wasn't as much technology as today. I still like classic games but now I download their apps on my smartphone and I may or may not need an opponent.

Recently, I played with my sister and it is fun while I am beating her but sometimes I let her win loll... (not true). The truth is that I don't like losing but I've learned that I don't always have the correct pieces that sum many points but even so, I don't make it easy for her, and I enjoy the rest of the match.

Experiencing defeats in life is not cool, many of these bring tears, a feeling of emptiness in the heart, and maybe some long nights but in the same way that occurs in a game, I know it is like a match and there are others more to start yet.

Life is like a big roller coaster that consists of many turns where at times we are up and down, for that reason, it's better to take a deep breath and enjoy it.

The advantage that represents having Jesus Christ in my life is that regardless of the bad happens to me, He uses it for my wellness and transforms it into a blessing. Psalms 30:11 (NIV) quotes:

> You turned my wailing into dancing; you removed my sackcloth and clothed me with joy,

I attest that it's true. I have experienced harsh storms (difficulties) but God is faithful, he always gives me a sweet refuge and shows me a peaceful bonanza at the end of the storm.
