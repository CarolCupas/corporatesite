Regularly, I read books, online articles, etc.  and one day I found a phrase that I think is accurate, it says: 

> _The experience is a tough teacher because apply the test first and then it teaches us the lesson_

I have learned that in my life, things do not always happen as I hope but it doesn't necessarily mean that it is something bad, unlike, it may be that moment wasn't right, that there are better opportunities to discover, it won't be entirely good for me or simply I don't know the reason, for example, the loss of loved ones among others situations. In the midst of that, I believe that everything has a purpose that I have to find to learn the lesson of that experience.

It's true there are things that make me dream like being a mother but after waiting for some years, I realize that I am happy with my cute family and believe that not all the couples are destined to have large families to be happy.

This isn't about positivism or living with my feet in the clouds, for me, it is about attitude. The following phrase sums it up nicely:

> You are 10% what happens to you and **90%** how you face it

It all depends on how we decide to act in the face of unexpected circumstances, ingratitude, hypocrisy, pain, and others. Sure, it will be fantastic if everything flows smoothly, but if the challenges didn't come up, how could we achieve the victory that would take us to the next level?

Here, I share a beautiful passage from the bible that always encourages me, it's found in 2 Corinthians 4:8-9 (NIV)

> ... We are hard pressed on every side, but not crushed; perplexed, but not in despair; persecuted, but not abandoned; struck down, but not destroyed...

So, as far as I'm concerned, I choose to trust and believe that the best is yet to come.
