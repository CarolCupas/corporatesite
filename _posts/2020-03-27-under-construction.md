¿Have you heard the phrase "no one can give what they don't have"? At times, I have had high expectations of people, especially those closest to me (family and friends). However, on more than one occasion, I have been disappointed and felt downhearted.

It's inevitable not to expect anything from no one and reap what we have sown: whoever loves expects to be reciprocated, whoever extends a hand expects to be shaken by another one but the reality it's not always so. ¿Solution? Never expect anything from anyone.

I don't exclude myself, certainly, I've disappointed many people at some point, the important is not to judge ourselves, but to put ourselves in the position of that person and reflect. We all have a personality formed by what we learned from our childhood at home to what we experienced since then. If we hope to be accepted as we are, we must be willing to accept others as they are as well.

> We can't demand what we are not capable of giving... it's unfair

We are work in progress, which means we are able to change and enhance throughout life, but his process begins with our internal will to do so and not due to external pressure.

> Isaiah 64:8 (NIV) says
>
> **Yet you, Lord, are our Father. We are the clay, you are the potter; we are all the work of your hand.**

![](/img/photo/CC playa 1.jpg)The way I started to leave behind my expectations of others and accepted them with their virtues and defects was putting myself in their shoes and imagine how awful is to be rejected or judged for being as I am, which isn't precisely bad but different from what others expect (their expectations).

A huge relief is having a wonderful heavenly Father that loves me even when I didn't meet him. 

> Isaiah 44:2 (NIV)
>
> This is what the Lord says he who made you, who formed you in the womb, and who will help you: Do not be afraid, Jacob, my servant, Jeshurun,\[a\] whom I have chosen.

How **blessed** I am!
