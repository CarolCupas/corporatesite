excerpt: I've heard that dreaming costs nothing, but perhaps not dreaming comes at
  a high price because it closes the doors of possibilities to explore and achieve
  the unimaginable.

The popular proverb is "_the worst attempt is the one that is not done_" but I like my own version more: "_the **best** attempt is the one that is done_". The meaning is the same, however changing words, the connotation of the sentence is different, from negative (worst) to positive (best).

Today's children seem to be born with an integrated chip to facilitate them to use technology but the truth is that nobody was born knowing things but rather learning them; from the basics such as starting to walk to the most complex ones such as the development machine learning algorithms, demand our motivation that drives us to try it.

Easily, we find thousands of excuses when a challenge arises, a classic example is "I'm going to lose weight", however, a few days later, we quit the exercises and said goodbye to the diet. Although the excuses may be valid, it doesn't mean that we can't try one more time and achieve it.

> Motivation is **essential**, believing in ourselves, recognize our limitations but also our potential to go for it. Don't underestimate yourself, wanting is power.

The changes of success or not are equal, fifty-fifty. Our part is to make the decision of where we want to focus our thoughts and energy: towards everything that can go wrong which leads to discouragement or towards everything that we can achieve that motivates us. That is where the proverb "_the worst attempt is the one that is not done_" fits in. For me, an unrealized attempt is a sure failure, we won't achieve anything, however, trying something opens us the door of the possibilities. 

> Isaiah 41:10 (NIV) So do not fear, for I am with you; do not be dismayed, for I am your God. I will strengthen you and help you; I will uphold you with my righteous right hand.

Great leaders and characters of this generation have succeeded and achieved their dreams because they were brave enough to challenge themselves. My daily challenge is to be the best version of me that can be. I don't know what impact it will have on the world, but at least I hope to be a blessing to the world around me, I lose nothing by trying.
