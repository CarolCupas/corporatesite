excerpt: Living the present is a gift, laugh and share smiles today, put on your best
  outfit today, call your loved ones and tell them how much you miss them, hanging
  out with friends, embrace your dreams today because you don't know if there are
  more opportunities.

Living one day at a time knowing that tomorrow is not promised for anyone, makes me appreciate what is really valuable. I am aware of life is fleeting and everything can change when you least expect it.

I have always thought that it's important to plan, not to postpone anything for later, and not to make decisions lightly, but there must be a balance. Usually, I meditate before deciding to do something, I evaluate scenarios in my mind and confess that things can accumulate and I get to worry about things that have not happened yet or that I can not change, so I remember the following verse of the bible:

> Therefore do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will worry about itself. Each day has enough trouble of its own.
>
> Matthew 6:34 (NIV)

... and I tell myself that makes no sense spending time worrying about anything. In fact, if today was my last day on earth, I shouldn't waste it feeling bad, instead, I should be grateful for the chance I have to enjoy the company of my loved ones, hear their voices, looking to their eyes and even in the distance, express them my love.

Not long ago, someone asked me "Â¿can you imagine if we could rewind time?", although it might be useful, the life doesn't include that option, nonetheless, life offers us a new opportunity each day to start from scratch as a blank canvas to design the first day of the rest of our life.

On my end, I propose myself to write good chapters in my remaining days and first of all, take advantage of each these to answer the calls of relatives, send messages to friends, meet my neighbors, share coffees with Marvin, thanking God for his fidelity and for all that He has planned for me.
