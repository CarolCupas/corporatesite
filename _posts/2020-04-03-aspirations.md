  the responses are usually variable

People change and their aspirations as well. If today, I had to respond to ¿how do I look within 5 years? any answer would be absurd. Looking at my version from five years ago, I could say "you don't have an idea" and it's because almost nothing that I have experienced in recent years, happened as I imagined, someway, has been even better.

Of course, I have a desire for self-improvement and I have spent many years of my life preparing myself to be a competent professional and successful in what I do but what money can't buy is what I aspire the most, for example having a place called home.

When I moved to Madrid, I went from having a duplex to a small loft, from having a 5-passenger SUV to using the subway among other things more, but I admit that my life was pleasantly simplified. Obviously, sometimes it's phenomenal to have more space and freedom to move around, however, I don't need that to be happy.

My aspiration as a professional is that my job is appreciated, that it serves to help other people also do their job and the resulting work will be a huge contribution to the company in order to comply or exceed the established goals. Sure, The payment must be fair and the promotions being timely.

There is nothing more unpleasant than feeling that you don't fit in a place or your work hard isn't being valued; people are the most valuable asset of a company so whether I don't feel comfortable, I'll get out of it soon unless something changes.

During one of my jobs, I lost a good colleague who passed away, he was really kind, worked overtime, but had time to make jokes. It was like a bucket of cold water to see how the company replaced him the following week, which opened my eyes to realize that nobody is indispensable for a company and the show must go on.

So far, I aspire to have a good job where I am valued for who I am and what I contribute, having a family who feels and knows loved by me, having trusted friends and mainly dreaming big because I still  have no idea of what is coming in the future, I believe God has something awesome in mind:

> Jeremiah 29:11 (NIV). For I know the plans I have for you,” declares the Lord, “plans to prosper you and not to harm you, plans to give you hope and a future.
