excerpt: 'I once read that there are three kinds of people in the world: 1. People
  who make things happen, 2. People who see how things happen, 3. People who ask what
  happens ... since then, I decided to be part of the first and become the protagonist
  of my life. '

If you don't know me, I'll describe myself as a kind, organized, diplomatic, responsible person (meet my promises), very analytical (look for answers anywhere), strong principles, discreet (you won't realize if I'm upset) and as a friend, you can count on me.

Some of my defects are my limited patience (I hate wasting time), I prefer don't say anything if there is nothing good to say but I share my opinion and I don't like to depend on others.

My profession is Computer systems engineer but always, my dream was to be a veterinarian. I like horses and dogs, I enjoy their company and abilities to speak to us without words. I changed my mind after a few surgical experiences at my dad's clinic where I discovered that I felt dizzy when I saw or smelled blood so it would be pretty hard for me to become a vet.

Later, I thought about becoming an architect because I used to draw and participate in my elementary school contests, winning some of those. I also admire the artworks, the architecture of the cities, in fact, **photography** is one of my main hobbies. Recently, I've learned how to use some photo editors and create designs with my photo catalog.

In addition, I love **interior design**. When I bought my first house, I knew that no wall would be blank. I like to add a touch of color and play with the furniture arrangement. Finally, I studied technology because of the possibilities that the career offered and due to the technologies are the future.

I consider myself a curious person and always I look for something new to learn or do. Someday, I wish to speak French and play the violin. The **music** is present all the days of my life, I enjoy it a lot (btw, my name means Christmas song and that's my favorite season as well).

Cooking is not passion however sometimes I cook and pleasantly surprised me with my dishes. I am _foodie_, enjoy trying new food to make comments about it or recommendations.

I am a _chocolate lover_ and drink coffee too. I have greats memories of my grandparents' house where I woke up in the morning with the delicious coffee aroma recently made.

Worth mentioning that I'm married to one of my best friends, **Marvin**, and at the moment we have two smart and lovely pets.
