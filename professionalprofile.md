I started my professional career when I graduated as a **Computer System engineer** at the Technological University in Panama in 2005. I am interested in everything related to technology and after working in many companies belong to different sectors such as banking, software development, and consulting, I also wanted to study an MBA and teaching. I have been able to manage projects, lead teams, and provide training.
